Problem statement
Data type refers to the type of value a variable has and the way the computer interprets it.



Each data type has a different size. You’ve studied 5 different data types and the sizes of the data types:

Integer: 4 bytes
Long: 8 bytes
Float: 4 bytes
Double: 8 bytes
Character: 1 byte


You’re given a data type. Print its size in bytes.



Example :
Input: Long

Output: 8

Explanation: The size of a Long variable is given as 8 bytes.
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1:
Long


Sample Output 1:
8


Explanation of sample input 1 :
The size of a Long variable is given as 8 bytes.





Solution

  

import java.util.Scanner;

public class dataytpe {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Scanner object to take user input
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Prompt the user to enter a data type
        System.out.print("Enter a data type (Integer, Long, Float, Double, Character): ");
        String dataType = scanner.nextLine();

        // Close the scanner to prevent resource leaks
        scanner.close();

        // Determine and print the size of the specified data type
        switch (dataType.toLowerCase()) {
            case "integer":
                System.out.println("Size of Integer: 4 bytes");
                break;
            case "long":
                System.out.println("Size of Long: 8 bytes");
                break;
            case "float":
                System.out.println("Size of Float: 4 bytes");
                break;
            case "double":
                System.out.println("Size of Double: 8 bytes");
                break;
            case "character":
                System.out.println("Size of Character: 1 byte");
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("Invalid data type");
        }
    }
}

Time Complexity
O(1), that is constant time.

The time is proportional to the number of data types and the length of their names(for string comparison).

Since the data types are fixed, we can consider it as constant time.

Hence the time complexity is O(1).

Space Complexity
O(1), that is constant space.

We are not creating any variable thus not using any auxiliary space.

Hence the space complexity is O(1).
